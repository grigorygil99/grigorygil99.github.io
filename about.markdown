My intentions with this blog is to force myself discussing Hegelian concepts however the style of exposition I may present it in.
A year and a half ago I started reading the Phenomenology of Spirit, with it accumulated alot of notes from various chapters 
that needs constant rewriting and revisions, so I decided to create this blog where I post my readings from those notes.
The exposition of these notes may vary, some of them may have a graphical rendering (drawn like a manic), some only textual.

And I don't advise to take my interpretations as some inherently Hegelian ones, my goal is to understand the Logic, but as 
Hegel mentions in its preface of PhG - the initial path starts as a less developed one, but it leads to the succession of another more 
developed path built upon the correction of the former, and the biggest mistake is being afraid to commit mistakes.
