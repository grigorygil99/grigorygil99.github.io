title: Remarks on the introduction of Perception

Perception builds upon Sense-Certainty by having 
the universal as its principle.
While in Sense-Certainty the 'I' was dealing 
with describing what the This is, in the end 
when the subject tries to describe the This 
it fails inherently due to him only using 
particulars.

The concluding point in Sense-Certainty is that 
describing immediateness, or something that 
is immediate, will lead to its failure, to its opposite, 
due to the inherent behaviour in which something 
immediate defines as.

So, by employing Perception as universal, 
Pure Being will lead to have the immediate self-separated, 
intertwined moments into universals - the I and the object.
In other words those two moments can also be described 
as the 1) the movement of pointing out or the act of perceiving, 
and 2) the movement as a simple event or the object perceived.


What is the object?

In its essence, the object is the same as its movement - 
the movement is the unfolding and differentiation of 
the two moments of perceiving and perceived.
And the object is the apprehended togetherness of the moments.

In itself (for us, the subject), due to Perception adhering the principle of universality in its essence,
the contrasting element of this abstraction - both the moments of perceiving and perceived - 
are unessential.


The main turn around of this is that those both moments due to originating from Pure Being 
are also universals/essential.
And since those two moments are differentiating from one another, then one is essential, 
and this is the object, whilst the act of perceiving is the unessential due to its manifold 
result of the act being or not realizable.
