title: Deeper dwelve into sense-certainty

In the previous post of sense-certainty I did some 
general explanation of the behaviour of Pure Being in sense-certainty 
in a very abbreviated way.
I was not satisfied with the result, since in the next sub-chapter 
"perception" Hegel tries to explain in his terminology the jump of 
sense-certainty into perception.
This post is a way to understand the terminologies used within the 
context of sense-certainty.



# What is Pure Being?

Pure Being is the whole of Being 
in which it is constituted by two posited terms, 
the object and the otherness,
and these terms can be determined as being 
immediate or being mediated.

In layman's terms
object is considered as a form of a simple, immediate being or essence.
otherness is considered as (a form?) of a unessential and mediated (being?).


Huge doubts if the otherness can be considered a being,
atleast in sc, due to otherness not being in-itself while 
the object is in-itself, there is a undisputed guarantee 
of the objects unmediated existence (well, undisputed  
by what sc defines the object as).
There is also the point that due to object being Being 
there should be a contrasting element that opposes 
to this identification, maybe the otherness is just a Being 
that rejects its own identity i.e. the Being of non-Being?

At the same time, they are two terms but 
they relate through each other - due to dialectical nature, 
although not certain if this is only for sense-certainty.
Supposedly in sc otherness is mediated (through the object? probably), 
because otherness is a knowing which knows the object due 
to object's being - and this knowing may be or not be.
And the object is the true, the essence, regardless of the 
otherness knowing its existence.

In this manifold we can see that there is a relation 
(object to otherness) which is unbreakable due to object's 
determination as essence and another relation which is 
breakable, optional i.e. the act of otherness knowing or 
not knowing the existence of the object, there is no 
knowledge if the object is not there.


# What is the difference of immediate certainty and certainty?

The Pure Being of certainty defines it as immediate, so it's 
just an explicit connotation it being immediate.
A being that is negative is a being that relates to others 
by the other's opposition and at the same time the being 
is not affected by the other's existence.
In other words we could say that being is constituted by 
the other precisely by the other's opposite - a constitution 
of no constitution (absence of relation) and at the same time 
being is independent from the other (being is an in-itself?).

This reveals that the object that sense-certainty proposes it 
as essence is false - then what is it?


# What is even the This?
The This is the product of splitting Pure Being into:
- The This as I (immediate and mediated in sc),
- The This as object (immediate and mediated in sc)

The This is taken as a twofold shape of its being,
one shape as 'Now' and the other shape as 'Here'.
Due to these shapes having within them the dialectic,
(from the This? or inherently? from the Pure Being?)
they will receive a form as intelligible as the This itself is.
Meaning that they will also have a manifold shape of their being.

On reflection (comprehension),
neither are only immediately present, but also mediated.

Mediation within sc:
- I have this sc through the thing.
- The thing is in sc through I.



# Before dialectical analysis (aprehension)
In pure being the true content is the truth i.e. what pure being says.
Pure being says the object is essence.

# After dialectical analysis (comprehension)
In pure being the true content is the universal i.e. what pure being is
The object is a negative due to its behaviour.


# Questions to be answered

Again, what is pure being, how is it different in sense-certainty and 
perception? Are the principles it generates always the same i.e 
object and other, object-to-other, other-to-object?
Do the beings get inscribed as essence/instance?
Do the relations get inscribed as necessary/unnecessary?

Hegel does use connotations such as 'simple' and 'pure' 
does this mean something undialectical?

Are there beings that are affected with 
the other's existence?

Pure being is inessential but negation and mediation within it are essential?

Something determined as negative can be described as inessential?


(true = true content = essence?)

(content = being?)
